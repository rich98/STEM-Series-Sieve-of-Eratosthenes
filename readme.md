## STEM Series: Sieve of Eratosthenes
The Sieve of Eratosthenes, a mathematical method from antiquity, is used to identify all prime numbers up to a specified limit.

The process involves iteratively identifying the multiples of each prime number as composite (meaning, not prime), beginning with the first prime number, 2. The multiples of a specific prime are produced as a sequence of numbers that start from that prime, with a constant difference between them equal to that prime. This characteristic sets the sieve apart from the method of trial division, which tests each potential number sequentially for divisibility by each prime. After all multiples of each identified prime have been labeled as composites, the remaining numbers that are unmarked are primes.

The earliest known mention of the sieve (Ancient Greek: κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους, kóskinon Eratosthénous) is found in Nicomachus of Gerasa’s Introduction to Arithmetic, a book from the early 2nd century CE. The book credits the method to Eratosthenes of Cyrene, a Greek mathematician from the 3rd century BCE, but it describes the sieving process by odd numbers instead of by primes.

As one of several prime number sieves, it is considered one of the most effective methods for finding all smaller primes. It can also be used to identify primes in arithmetic progressions.
